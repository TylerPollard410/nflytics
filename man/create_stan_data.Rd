\examples{
# Original training data (reproduce fit_stan_data)
train_data <- create_stan_data(before_season = 2006)

# Test data for specific seasons
test_data <- create_stan_data(specific_seasons = c(2020, 2021))

# Regular season only
regular_data <- create_stan_data(specific_seasons = 2023, max_week = 18)

# Extend for forecasting
forecast_data <- create_stan_data(
  specific_seasons = 2023,
  forecast_weeks = 4,
  verbose = TRUE
)
