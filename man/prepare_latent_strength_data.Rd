  data,
  season_col = "season",

\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing (at minimum) columns for season, week,
home and away teams, and home/away scores.}

\item{season_col}{Column name holding season identifiers.}

\item{week_col}{Column name holding within-season week numbers.}

\item{home_team_col}{Column name holding home-team abbreviations.}

\item{away_team_col}{Column name holding away-team abbreviations.}

\item{home_score_col}{Column name holding home scores.}

\item{away_score_col}{Column name holding away scores.}

\item{result_col}{Optional column containing signed game results (home minus
away). When omitted the difference of the score columns is used.}

\item{total_col}{Optional column containing game totals. When omitted the sum
of the score columns is used.}

\item{hfa_col}{Optional column indicating whether the listed home team gets
home-field advantage. Accepts either logical indicators or the strings
"Home"/"Away"/"Neutral". Defaults to treating every game as home-field.}

\item{teams}{Optional ordered vector of team identifiers. When supplied, the
output will respect this ordering. When omitted the teams are inferred from
the data and sorted alphabetically.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print a short progress summary.}
}
\value{
A list ready to pass to Stan, with attributes storing the lookup
tables used to encode teams, weeks, and seasons.
